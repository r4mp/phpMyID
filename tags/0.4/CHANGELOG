Version 0.4
- Added support for external configuration files, and multiple user setups.
- Adjusted the idp_url parameter to remove the port number if it is a default
  value. This was necessary because some clients have decided to normalize the
  URLs they receive, and while such behavior is valid according to RFCs 2396 and
  3986, it's just a pain for me. I'd rather that all URLs be validated strictly
  as provided.

Version 0.3
- The project has been renamed to phpMyID to avoid confusion with
  www.myOpenId.com
- Fixed a bug related to the use of the 'auth-int' Digest qop. This would have
  only affected Opera users (as it's the only browser which supports auth-int).

Version 0.2
- Added support for PHP4, including a better mechanism for getting Digest
  authentication headers which should work with non-Apache servers
- Added a (hidden) logout mode, usable by calling
  MyID.php?openid.mode=logout
- Fixed a bug which occurred when associate mode was called and was unable to
  produce a secure key. Future queries from that handle would then fail
  check_authentication mode queries
- The lifetime for a smart-mode client is now same as the default cache life of
  the session minus ten seconds, which should be just under three hours
- Renamed the 'sha20' function to 'sha1_20' (to designate using 'sha1' to get
  a 20 byte hash)
- Some code and debug cleanup


Version 0.1
- Initial Release
