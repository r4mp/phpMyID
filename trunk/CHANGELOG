Version 0.2
- Added support for PHP4, including a better mechanism for getting Digest
  authentication headers which should work with non-Apache servers
- Added a (hidden) logout mode, usable by calling
  myOpenID.php?openid.mode=logout
- Fixed a bug which occurred when associate mode was called and was unable to
  produce a secure key. Future queries from that handle would then fail
  check_authentication mode queries
- The lifetime for a smart-mode client is now same as the default cache life of
  the session minus ten seconds, which should be just under three hours
- Renamed the 'sha20' function to 'sha1_20' (to designate using 'sha1' to get
  a 20 byte hash)
- Some code and debug cleanup


Version 0.1
- Initial Release
